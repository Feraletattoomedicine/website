Creating beautiful blackout tattoos requires a diverse set of skills and techniques to achieve a smooth, velvety finish over time. 

During six years, in France, I had the privilege of working alongside one of the world’s leading artists in this style, Dekalcomanu. I assisted him as a translator and helper while he conducted masterclasses for some of the most renowned tattooers globally. This experience was invaluable, allowing me to absorb a wealth of knowledge that I have since put into practice.

To create a stunning blackout tattoo, several essential factors come into play:
 
- Machine Settings: Applying the right alterations is crucial, and requires quite some adjustments and understanding of the tools.  
- Velocity: Mastering the speed at which you work can significantly impact the outcome.  
- Efficiency: Streamlining the process ensures both artistry and comfort.  
- Understanding Skin: Different skin types and textures require tailored approaches.  
- Repairing Scar Tissue: With care, we can enhance the appearance of damaged areas.  
- Proper Aftercare: This is vital for ensuring soft, quick healing.  

While I take care of these dimensions, the final experience is a collaboration between us, truly a team effort.

Since honing my blackout skills in 2018, I’ve mastered the art of fine-tuning my coil machines and power supply, always ready with my soldering iron and clamps. Understanding the complex variety of skin types has been fundamental in increasing my efficiency, ensuring a swift process and rapid healing.

Although challenging, a full arm blackout can be completed in under 3.5 hours. However, many clients prefer to do it over two sessions, as the sensation can be particularly intense.

It’s also possible to repair scarred or damaged skin from previous tattoos. While we may not restore it to perfection, we can smooth its hills and furrows into a harmonious flat surface.

The aftercare is especially important for a blackout. The first healing part should take less than a week and you’re skin will gently flake and peel as a snake.
You can check what will be needed on the [aftercare page](/aftercare) but I will explain to you the steps when we meet.

The multidimensional nature of blackout tattoos is unmatched. The sensation is uniquely intense, differing greatly from that of a traditional tattoo due to the size of the needles and the speed of application. Your nervous system receives a flood of information in a short time, which can feel overwhelming.

Yet, even as the work occurs on the surface, I’ve witnessed profound emotional and psychological effects. For many, the experience is cathartic, working on a deeper level of the psyche. As your skin darkens, a sense of lightness often emerges by the end of this transformative process.

I believe that this experience serves as a powerful rite of passage in our modern era, embodying a mysterious and profound journey.
