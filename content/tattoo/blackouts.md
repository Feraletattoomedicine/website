Blackouts require a variety of skills and techniques in order to make it look smooth as velvet as time passes.

When I was still living in France, I had the chance to work for 6 years with one of the best world known artists on this area : Dekalcomanu. He’s been offering masterclasses to some of the most renowned tattooers of the world, and I was assisting him as a translator and helper. I learned a lot during those years, to offer you my dedicated experience.

Several components are necessary to do blackouts : 
machine settings 
velocity
efficiency
knowledge of the different skins and skin textures
repairing scar tissue and damaged skin
proper aftercare for soft and quick healing
All the previous dimensions are mine to take care of. The last part is yours. It’s a team work.

While sharpening blackout specialized skills since 2018, I learned to master the art of subtly altering and tuning my coil machines and power supply, while increasing my efficiency in the blackout tattoo process and understanding of the skin’s complex variety.

ALTHOUGH IT IS CHALLENGING, A FULL ARM CAN BE DONE IN LESS THAN 3,5 HOURS. BUT YOU MIGHT PREFER TO DO IT IN 2 SESSIONS AS THE SENSATION IS PARTICULARLY INTENSE.

Nothing compares to the multidimensional aspects of blackouts. First of all, the sensation is very strong, intense and unique. It doesn’t have anything in common with a regular tattoo’s feeling because of the needles’ size and the speed of what’s happening. Your nervous system receives a lot of information in a small amount of time which can be unsettling and confusing. 
Although the action resides on the surface of your skin, I witnessed many times the deeper effect it can provoque on your mind and emotions. For most of us, the experience is cathartic and also works on a deeper level of your psyche. As your skin grows darker, there might be a sense of lightness appearing at the end of this deeply transformational process.
I believe this kind of experience acts as a powerful rite of passage of our modern era. And I believe in its mysterious dimension.

The aftercare is especially important for a blackout. You can check what will be needed here(lien vers aftercare) but I will explain to you the steps when we meet.
