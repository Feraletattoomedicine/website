To PREPARE YOUR SKIN, 
I would recommend moisturizing your skin daily during the week preceding our appointment.
Do not use scented creams, but instead pure organic coconut oil, or shea butter. 
You can also apply arnica oil 3 times a day during the 3 days prior to our appointment, for its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. That is especially recommended for large scale tattoos and blackouts.


For your AFTERCARE,
You will also need organic coconut oil or shea butter, and a soft soap with neutral pH, like baby soap for example.
Your work and home environment will have to be clean and be careful with your beloved pets. 
I will explain specifically the healing process you will need to follow, when we meet in person.


To make the best of our experience together, here are a few RECOMMENDATIONS : 
Get enough sleep and rest time the day before and after our appointment.
Have a nourishing meal before coming to your session and drink lots of water, it will help you and your skin.
Bring some snacks & water or favorite beverages. A tattoo day is a day to treat yourself with care and gentleness.
Wear comfortable clothes, preferably of dark color. Some ink can splash and we don’t want to ruin your favorite outfit. And anticipate your outfit depending on the area we’re tattooing, so that you are comfortable with your intimacy during the session.
Change your sheets before the session and prepare a clean towel, in case there is ink drip of the bandage during the first night.
