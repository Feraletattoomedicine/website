It’s all about having an unspoken dialogue with you as a whole, and with your various parts and dimensions. Working silently with the soul and the body, understanding its wishes and its shapes, diving into the specific textures of your skin to adapt to. As in every exchange, there might be some adjustments to make in order to create an harmonious conversation. Your voice might speak your mind, but your soul, and the unique vibration of your body will also make some demands that need to be heard. That’s where I offer my help, to be the translator of this invisible language and bring a lifelong offering on your skin’s surface. 
Sometimes our words are merely scratching the surface of the far deeper and subtle communication system that our beings are holding silently, using different ways of expression. 

There’s always been different words for the ways of transforming oneself and your community, the ways of healing, the ways of connecting to one another. I chose the words “LIMINAL MARKS” to speak about the in-between state I felt spending my life in. 

Varying from regular tattoos, their intent is to bring you healing on an holistic level.
