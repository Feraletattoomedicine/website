While the term "Shamanism" originates from the Tungus people of Siberia, the practice itself is as ancient as humanity and has been found worldwide. Some cultures have preserved these traditions, while others have lost aspects of them through conquests & Christianization. Yet, across time and space, we find striking similarities in these practices.

In today’s society, the essence of the Sacred often lies muted beneath the conditioning of our rational minds. Shamanism reawakens the understanding that all things are sacred in their own way and interconnected, bridging the visible and invisible realms, the animate and inanimate. It is not a belief system or religion but rather a sensuous and empirical experience that transcends individual egos, fostering a collective unity with all beings.

If you’re interested in learning more about shamanism, I recommend reading Mircea Eliade’s “Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy” and Michael Harner’s “The Way of the Shaman,” which explores modern applications of shamanic practices. You can find additional resources in my [Thoughts & Reflections](/thoughts-and-reflections) tab.

Healers today typically fall into three categories:

1. **Traditional Shamans:** Practitioners who operate within an unbroken tradition, continuing their work within their native culture.
  
2. **Bridge Shamans:** These individuals connect traditional practices with the modern Western world, often incorporating new rituals not originally part of their indigenous heritage.
  
3. **Spirit-Called Shamans:** Those called by Spirit to fulfill shamanic roles in their communities, regardless of their cultural distance from traditional practices.

I identify with the third category. Since an early age, I’ve straddled both worlds, and I have been a shamanic practitioner for nearly a decade. I have been a student of the Spirits first, and of their human intermediaries through the Foundation for Shamanic Studies, here in Canada, since 2023.

## WHAT KIND OF RITUALS CAN BE DONE DURING A SESSION ?

Shamanic practitioners focus on directing and balancing energies to restore harmony within the individual, their community, and the spirit world. The aim is to address imbalances on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels.

Here’s what you might expect during a personal session:

**Soul Retrieval:** This process helps reclaim lost parts of yourself that may have scattered due to past wounds. It’s like rediscovering hidden treasures of your soul.
  
**Power Animal Retrieval:** You connect with a protective animal spirit that provides strength and guidance, becoming a trusted ally on your journey.

**Shamanic Extraction:** In this healing ritual, blockages, known as intrusions, are removed from your energy system. These unwanted energies disrupt its proper functioning, and the extraction process restores balance.

**Shamanic Cleansing:** The process of removing negative energies or spirits from a space, creating a harmonious environment.

**Support for the Dying:** Offering guidance and companionship to the spirit of a dying person or assisting the spirit of the deceased, providing support for both the individual and their family during this transition.

**Rituals and Ceremonies:** Whether marking a significant life change or seeking clarity, I can guide you through personalized rituals—ranging from ceremonies that honor new beginnings to practices that reconnect you with nature and your inner self.

**Shamanic Counseling:** During sessions, I offer intuitive insights and guidance, utilizing spirit guides and divination techniques. This isn’t just spiritual advice; it’s about helping you understand yourself better and navigate your challenges with renewed perspective.

Shamanic healing is a deeply personal journey of discovery and rejuvenation, focused on reconnecting with parts of yourself and the world that may have been lost or overlooked. Other kind of services may be Each experience is unique, tailored to your individual needs.

## WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A SHAMANIC HEALING ?

While each practitioner has a unique approach, a typical healing session often begins with a diagnostic journey, followed by various healing ceremonies guided by the practitioner’s helping spirits.

Some may experience immediate relief, while others might require time to fully realize the benefits of the session. I often recommend integration work to help clients process and understand the healing they’ve received.

Don’t expect to be fully healed after just one session. While complete healing can sometimes happen, it usually takes time and is dependent on the issues being addressed. Shamanic healing focuses on restoring energy and balance rather than offering instant cures. You are the primary agent in your healing process. As a shamanic practitioner, I am here to help you connect with your own strength and energy source, but ultimately, it is up to you to confront the challenges and take the necessary steps toward recovery.

In communities that support shamanic practices, there is typically time and space for individuals to integrate and process their healing. In modern settings, it often falls to the practitioner and client to create their own resources and support systems to help adjust to changes in internal energies.


*It's worth noting that shamanic healing is not a substitute for conventional medical treatment but can be used as a complementary approach.*
