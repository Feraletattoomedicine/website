{{< testimonial 
name="Raphaël" 
text="At first... I was intimidated. The day I met Julie, she appeared to me like a witchy shield-maiden, she radiated sometting I could not quite grasp, but it got me short-breathing. Then the day came and I went to the shop to start my full left sleeve with Julie. It was like I saw someone radiating something totally different .  She was looking way more vulnerable and sensible. And... we sang. We sang  during the 4-5 hours of each 3 different sessions. She manages to install a deep connexion with her customers, I almost felt like in a meditative state. It was like I could feel the energy and emotions flowing  inside me while being tattooed. Like everything inside me had been scattered and was now coming back into place. A tear fell from time to time. Not because of the pain. But because of how I could finally feel second after second how healing those moments were. I am now feeling safer, stronger and more resilient than ever. And enriched with a friend. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for proving me that Magic still exists."

{{< testimonial name="Pablo" text="When I first spoke to Ferale of my tattoo project she  instantly understood what I wanted deep inside. She understood that I was seeking way more than a physical change. And that this change was motivated by a fierce will to evolve. She helped me to realize this and helped me push my limits. We went real big for my first tattoo but I couldn't be more happy about what came out of it. I am proud of this artwork that I wear. It is simply beautiful. But what matters most is that it really carries the essence of what I intended at that point of time and it accompanies me through the road of change I am roaming. I am extremely grateful to have crossed paths with such a smart, compassionate and talented soul and can't thank Ferale enough for her work." image="/img/testimonials/pablo.jpg" >}}

{{< testimonial name="Mitch" text="Julie was my first choice when I wanted to explore blackwork for my next tattoo, after seeing her work with other artists I had already worked with. She took the time to develop ideas, and on appointment day was ready to change and adapt to both my body and to thoughts brought up at the last minute. Julie works freehand, but ensures that before needle touches skin, the ideas are concrete and in line with her clients desires. Finally, while blackwork and extensive shading, particularly in sensitive areas, can be very painful; Julie has a gentle touch and a fast pace and keeps the mood light throughout the process. Strongly recommended, and I will be retuning once I have the next project in mind!" image="/img/testimonials/mitch.jpg" >}}
 
{{< testimonial name="Sarah" text="Pour ma part l'expérience a été unique, je n'ai jamais ressenti une telle puissance dans l'air pendant un tatouage. Tu as su me transmettre de belles énergies et je n'oublierai jamais ce moment! C'était hors du temps, et je suis très fière de porter cette marque sacrée sur mon bras. Elle me fait me sentir plus forte. Merci" image="/img/testimonials/sarah.jpg" >}}

{{< testimonial name="Nasser" text="After discovering Julie and her craft, I traveled from the USA to get a full leg sleeve with a total of 4 sessions. It was an incredible and enlightening experience. Julie created a beautiful and meaningful design for me based on my needs, incorporating symbols that resonates deeply with me. Her intuitive and spiritual guidance made the whole process special as well as the beautiful activation ceremony. It is rare to find an artist that works this way. Julie is very unique and highly recommended!" image="/img/testimonials/nasser.jpg" >}}
