### **LIMINAL MARKER * MEDICINE WOMAN**

Born and raised in France, I spent most of my life immersed in its rich culture and artistry. In 2023, I made the vibrant city of Montreal my new home, eager to embrace fresh inspirations and opportunities.

My journey into tattooing has been anything but linear. Practicing various artistic crafts since childhood, I chose the path of tattooing, drawn in by its ability to tell stories and evoke emotions. However, it took me five years of self-discovery, experimentation, and persistence before I finally picked up my first tattoo machine and needles in 2015.

Starting my career in a bustling walk-in tattoo & piercing shop, I was determined to learn as much as I could. I embraced every chance to grow, participating in numerous guest spots and conventions across different studios. These experiences allowed me to refine my skills and explore a variety of styles, all while forging connections with talented peers who generously shared their knowledge.

In 2021, I received a pivotal opportunity: a resident artist position from Dekalcomanu in Toulouse, France. For six transformative years, I honed my craft, delving into the intricate techniques of blackout tattoos and mastering coil machine modifications. This period not only solidified my technical skills but also helped me cultivate my unique artistic voice, blending influences from my travels and experiences.

Now, as I settle into Montreal's dynamic artistic community, I'm excited to continue evolving as an artist and to create meaningful, personalized tattoos that resonate with my clients. My journey is ongoing, and I look forward to what lies ahead.

## PRIMAL BLACK

I’ve always been fascinated by the roots of human history, the deep ones, residing in the soil and cave walls. I spent many years studying symbols, symbolism and archetypes throughout the world, aiming to identify and connect similar patterns in different cultures. The fact that those symbols inform our stories as humans and reveal some parts of our mysterious connections within the big web of life is, for me, an incredible source of awe and a sight to behold. Driven by the awareness that within the myriad differences of human cultures, there is a shared preoccupation with certain transcendental elements, I wanted to reflect this in my tattooing practice.

That led me to create, in 2019, what I named the “Primal Black” style. It joins the desire to offer modern, committed & healing rites of passage, with an anchor in our primordial archetypes.


## SPIRITUAL PATH 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve walked between worlds, navigating the delicate balance between realities, connecting the old and the new, and merging the seemingly superficial with profound spiritual truths. This duality has shaped not only my artistic expression but also my understanding of life itself.

My journey into spirituality began as a quest for deeper meaning. It led me to explore various practices that resonate with my soul. As a tarot reader, I discovered the power of symbols and intuition, learning to unlock insights hidden within the cards. This practice became a gateway, guiding me to further explore energy work. I trained as a magnetizer, channeling energy to promote healing and balance, and became a level 3 reiki practitioner, harnessing the universal life force to support others on their paths.

Eventually, my spiritual exploration brought me to shamanism, a profound and primordial tradition that connects us to nature, ancestors, and the unseen realms. Through shamanic practices, I learned to journey between worlds, accessing wisdom and healing that transcends ordinary perception. This experience deepened my understanding of interconnectedness and the cyclical nature of life.


These explorations are woven into my work as a tattoo artist, where I blend my artistic vision with the spiritual significance of body art. Each tattoo is a sacred expression, a personal narrative that honors the journey of the individual and its lineage. I believe that tattooing is not just a form of art but a transformative experience, allowing a person to embody their stories and intentions.

As I continue to walk this path, I am committed to fostering connections between art and spirituality, past and present, self and community. My work is a reflection of this journey, and I am excited to share it with others, inviting them to explore their own depths along the way.
